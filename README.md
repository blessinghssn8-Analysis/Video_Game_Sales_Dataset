## Video_Game_Sales_Dataset
Exploratory and insight-driven analysis of global video game sales using Python to reveal growth patterns and demand signals.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global video game sales data to uncover market trends, platform performance, and genre dynamics. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) with ensemble machine learning models to identify key drivers of sales and evaluate predictive patterns across regions.

## Problem Statement
The video game industry is highly competitive and fragmented across platforms, genres, and geographic markets. Understanding the factors that influence sales performance is critical for demand forecasting, release planning, and strategic decision-making.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical sales trends across regions, platforms, and genres  
- Identify key features influencing global sales performance  
- Build and evaluate ensemble machine learning models for sales prediction  
- Translate analytical findings into actionable business insights  

## Dataset Description
- **Data Type:** Structured tabular data  
- **Content:** Game titles, platforms, genres, publishers, release years, and regional sales  
- **Target Variable:** Global sales  
- **Key Features:** Platform, genre, publisher, regional sales, release year  

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing values, filtering, feature selection)  
- Exploratory data analysis to uncover trends, distributions, and correlations  
- Feature engineering and categorical encoding  
- Train-test split for robust model validation  
- Ensemble model training and tuning  
- Performance evaluation using regression metrics  

## Models Used
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  

## Evaluation Metrics
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- R-squared (R²)  

## Key Insights
- Platform and genre are strong predictors of global sales performance  
- Sales distribution varies significantly by region, with North America leading overall volume  
- Ensemble models effectively capture non-linear relationships in sales data  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab  


##Key Insights
- Global video game sales are heavily concentrated among top platforms and publishers, indicating a winner-takes-most market.
- Action, Sports, and Shooter genres consistently outperform others in global sales.
- Platform lifecycle strongly influences sales, with early-to-mid lifecycle years generating peak performance.
- A small subset of publishers accounts for a disproportionate share of total global sales.
- Legacy platforms show declining sales, signaling clear generational shifts in consumer demand.
- Regional sales patterns materially differ, impacting genre and platform success.

##  Market & Sales Trends
Sales trends track closely with console release cycles, with sharp growth following major hardware launches and gradual decline toward end-of-life. Certain platforms dominate specific eras, while genre popularity remains relatively stable globally, led by high-engagement, mass-market categories. Publisher dominance suggests scale, brand equity, and distribution reach are key competitive advantages.

##  Regional Performance Insights
- North America and Europe drive the majority of global sales, favoring Action and Sports titles.
- Japan exhibits distinct preferences, with stronger performance in role-playing and platform-specific titles.
- Regional sales diversification is limited, reinforcing the need for tailored market strategies rather than global uniformity.
- Emerging regions contribute marginally but represent long-term growth opportunities.

##  Business & Strategic Recommendations
- Align game release timing with platform lifecycle peaks to maximize sales potential.
- Prioritize high-performing genres while selectively innovating in niche categories for regional markets.
- Leverage publisher scale through cross-franchise marketing and platform partnerships.
- Customize regional strategies, particularly for Japan, where genre preferences diverge significantly.
- Use historical sales decay patterns to inform investment, sequel timing, and platform transition planning.

##  Portfolio Value Statement
This analysis demonstrates strong exploratory data analysis, trend identification, and business interpretation skills. It highlights the ability to translate raw sales data into executive-level insights and actionable strategy. The work reflects clear data storytelling aligned with real-world commercial decision-making.
